    5/29 update:
    Got the post request to work, but for some reason backend is only getting the question:String pair
    doesn't eget the currID, but maybe that's for the better *look at line 28

    made a state to set the "latest" question to to keep track, my need to incldue more info in the obj

    currID resets, so its isn't helpful in tracking order, maybe the indecies of the array are good enough
    can change the setState line in 28
